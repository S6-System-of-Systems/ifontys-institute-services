VALUES (1, 'THE MATERIAL COMPOSITION IN THE PROCESSING OF CANDLE PRODUCTION', 'This research relates to a candle composition containing non-hydrogenated oil and at least one of long chain hydrocarbon and long-chain hydrocarbon derivatives. A candle composition having non-hydrogenated oil and a solidifying amount of congealing reagent. A candle composition having paraffin, non-hydrogenated oil, and a solidifying amount of a congealing reagent comprising petroleum, oxidized petrolatum oxidized long-chain hydrocarbons, or modified hydrocarbons. A process for making a candle composition is also provided, the process comprising mixing together a  non hydrogenated oil and a congealing amount of a congealing reagent, heating mixture to a temperature of 75-900C, preferably 75-800C, the cooling the mixture and pouring into a container. The study also carried out the standard procedure that  results in the production of candle from the composition of candle. This article gives an overview and description of  the raw materials and additives that are used for the manufacturing of candle and explains the combustion process in the candle flames. Starting with the definition and classification of candles the criteria are presented which are crucial for the safe handling of candles i.e. ensuring they are harmless in relation to both people and the environment. The structure and content of a proposed European quality standard for candle are derived from these criteria.'),
       (2, 'NUTRITIONAL PHYTOCHEMICAL AND MICROBIAL CONTENT OF BOMAX COSTATUM LEAVES', 'Plants have been an important source of medicine for thousands of years. Even today, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that up to 80% of people still rely primarily on traditional remedies such as herbs for their medicines. The medicinal value of these plants is due to the presence of a variety of phytochemicals and their elemental composition. The role of medicinal plants in disease prevention or control has been attributed to the antioxidant properties of their constituents, usually associated with a wide range of amphipathic molecules that are broadly referred to as polyphenolic compounds. There is a growing interest in the development and evaluation of natural antioxidants from medicinal plant materials in the food industry and the field of preventive health care. Among those herbs, one promising species is Bombax costatum leaves, which is native to the sub-Himalayan regions of Northwest India. It is widely distributed throughout Africa, Saudi Arabia, Southeast Asia, the Caribbean Islands, and South America. Every part of Bombax costatum leaves has medicinal properties and is commercially exploitable for the development of medicinal and industrial by-products. Traditionally, the leaves, fruits, flowers, and immature pods of this tree are edible; they are used as a highly nutritive vegetable in many countries, particularly in India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Hawaii, and some African nations. In developing nations, Bombax costatum leaves is used as an alternative to imported food supplements to treat and combat malnutrition, especially among infants and nursing mothers, by virtue of its chemical constituents. Several valuable reviews of the ethno botanical uses of Bombax costatum leaves are available. It has been found to be a good source of polyphenols and antioxidants. Phytochemicals such as vanillin, omega fatty acids, carotenoids, ascorbates, tocopherols, beta-sitosterol, moringine, kaempferol, and quercetin have been reported in its flowers, roots, fruits, and seeds. The leaves, in particular, have been found to contain phenolics and flavonoids; these compounds have various biological activities, including antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, immunomodulatory, antidiabetic, antiatherogenic, and hepatoprotective functions and the regulation of thyroid status. Moreover, leaves contain trace elements that are essential to human health. For instance, magnesium, iron, selenium, and zinc play an important role in metabolism, and interest in these elements is increasing together with reports relating trace element status and oxidative diseases. However, a recent study has shown that dried Bombax costatum leaves contain lead at very high values of 352.0 mg/L. Therefore, it is very important to identify the mineral composition of Bombax costatum leaves that are widely consumed by humans and animals. In Mexico, Bombax costatum leaves are widely cultivated in different zones of the country and are found in more than ten states from Sonora to Oaxaca on the Pacific side. Few studies have been conducted on nutritional and phytochemical composition; however, to date, a detailed composition of the leaves of Bombax costatum leaves that is native to Mexico has not been reported yet. In addition, it is important to bear in mind that the mineral and phenolic contents present in leaves depend on several factors such as geographical area where the plant is cultivated, type of soil, water and fertilizers, industrialization process, and storage conditions.'),

Cervical Cancers screening serves to detect the possibility that a cancer is present. The main objective of the study was to determine the knowledge and acceptability of Cervicals Cancer Screening among Female Part- Time Students in University of Benin. The hypothesis for the study was: there is no relationship between knowledge of cervical cancer and acceptability of cervical cancer screening. Survey research design was used in the study. Simple random sampling was used to select the sample. The sample consisted of 200 Female Part- Time Students in University of Benin. Data was collected using questionnaire. The study findings revealed that slightly above half more than half of (74%) of the respondents were between the age of 20-25 years, 58 (77%) respondents could not remember age of their first sexual intercourse, the majority 168(86%) of respondents have heard of cervical cancer, majority 126 (63%) of respondents heard about cervical cancer from media, hundred and two (51%) participants explained cervical cancer as abnormal lesion on the cervix, sixty four (32%) respondents stated that unprotected sexual intercourse is a risk factor of cervicals cancer, sixty (30%) of respondents stated that abnormal vaginal bleeding is a sign of cervical cancer, 120 (60%) respondents stated that cervical cancer can be detected by cervicals cancer screening, majority 194 (97%) of respondents stated that cervical cancers screening is done in hospital, majority 178 (89%) of respondents had never been screened for cervical cancers, majority 94 (47%) of respondents strongly agreed that cervical cancer screening is important, the majority 144(72%) of the respondents had no intention of going for cervicals cancer screening, majority 80 (40%) of respondents stated that lack of awareness to cervical cancers screening is a major barrier to cervical cancer screening. The study recommends among others that nurses should engage more on giving Information Education and Communication (IEC) at all levels of Health Care Delivery toward cervical cancers screening. Cervical cancers screening center should be made available in university of Benin health center at subsidized amount so that female students can easily access the service.'),
       (4, 'INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF EXTRACT OF BLACK PEAR, SOUP SOP, MONKEY SEED DURING LIPID OXIDATION', 'Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RON) are free radicals, which derived either from normal metabolic processes or from external sources (Magalhaes, 2006). These species are essential to energy supply, detoxification, chemical signalling and immune function (Dimitrios, 2006). However, overproduction of these free radical may lead to damage to valuable biomolecules such as DNA, lipids and proteins. These free radicals are often associated with the oxidation in food and biological systems which will cause oxidative rancidity in foods and the development of several human diseases such as neurological degeneration, diabetes and certain types of cancer (Magalhaes, 2006). An antioxidant is any substance which is capable of delaying, preventing the oxidative damage of lipids, protein and nucleic acids by reactive oxygen species, which include reactive free radicals such as superoxide, hydroxyl, peroxyl, alkoxyl and non-radicals such as hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous (Lim et al., 2007). Thus, antioxidants have gained numerous attention in the past few years, especially within the food, biological and agrochemical fields. There is increasing evidence that the consumptionof vegetables and fruits is associated with a reduced risk of degenerative disease such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and cataracts (Chinnici et al., 2004). This association is often attributed to the natural antioxidant present in fruits and vegetables, such as vitamin C and E, carotenoids, phenolic acids and flavonoids, which prevent free radical damage (Silva et al., 2004).'),
       (5, 'MODELLING AND SIMULATION OF A PRE-HOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE NETWORK USING TIMED COLOURED PETRI NETS', 'Pre-hospital emergencynetwork serves as a major gateway to the  Accident and Emergency (AE) department of hospitals which is affected by overcrowding, and majority of projects studying pre-hospital emergency care networkdeal only with ambulance or firemanlocalisationas a means of addressing the problems confronting the Accident and Emergency (AE) department. However, this research work studied in detail the patient flow through the pre-hospital emergency carenetwork. Taking into account not only fireman and private ambulances localisation, but also the otherservices performed in this network such as Emergency call service the service of the Emergency response teamusing Timed Coloured Petri Nets. In developing a Timed Coloured Petri Nets (TCPN) model for a pre-hospital emergency care network, the emergency service of the State of Osun (O’ambulance) was used as a case study. The developed pre-hospital emergency care network (TCPN) model consists of five sub modules. Arrival sub module modelled the arrival of emergency calls with different health cases. Sort call sub module modelled the call desk and how emergency calls are received by the available call desk agent (perm). Perm Decision sub-module modelled the decision of call desk agent (perm) based on the emergency cases. Rescue team (RT) Decision sub module modelled the decision and intervention of Rescue team. While the Rescue-to-hospital sub-module modelled the transportation of victims to hospital. The developed TCPN model was simulated using  CPN tools. The validation of the developed TCPN model was explored by carrying out the statistical analysis between the simulated and the observed emergency call cases under study. The simulation results of the developed TCPN model revealed the number of emergency cases that require immediate and urgent response as 2, 6 and 19 while those that require no immediate response as 8, 22, 64 for the first, second and third simulations respectively. Revealing that some emergency calls require no immediate response and patients do not need to be taken to the hospital. Statistically, there were no significant difference between the simulated and the observed number of emergency cases that require immediate and urgent response. Conclusively, this research work has been able to develop a TCPN model for studying a pre-hospital emergency care network. Also, the developed Timed Coloured Petri Nets model, through its simulation, could help in predicting the number of patients that do not need to be taken to the emergency department hence, reducing overcrowding in hospitals.'),
       (6, 'THE USE OF TRADITIONAL MEDICINE IN THE TREATMENT OF MALARIA AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN', 'Malaria is a life threatening parasitic disease transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes. In Nigeria, malaria is responsible for around 60% of the out-patient visits to health facilities, 30% of childhood death, 25% of death in children under one year and 11% of maternal deaths (National Population Commission, 2008; Noland et al., 2014). Similarly, about 70% of pregnant women suffer from malaria, which contributes to maternal anemia, low birth weight, still births, abortions and other pregnancy-related complications (Federal Ministry of Health Abuja, 2005). Presently, malaria remains one of the worst menaces of tropical countries of the world. It is a killer and debilitating disease that affects the physical and economic well-being of people living in endemic areas of Africa (WHO, 2008). Pregnant women are among those in the higher risk group (Okwa, 2003). Recent global estimate shows that there are between 300 – 500million clinical cases of malaria and between 1.50 – 2.70million deaths attributed to malaria annually (Greenwood, 2005). Pregnant women are at immense risk of malaria due to natural immune depression in pregnancy (Fievet, 2008). Hence, it is one of the most important health issues affecting pregnant women as it has a risk of jeopardizing the life of the woman or the fetus (WHO, 2010). Traditional herbal medicine could be described as “herbs, herbal materials, herbal preparations and finished herbal products whose content includes active ingredients parts of plants, or other plant materials, or combinations”. Herbal medicines can be in the form of liquids, powder, capsules, tablets or ointments. Some are pre-packaged while others are prepared when needed and are used not only to cure illness but to maintain or boost one’s health (WHO, 2002). In Africa, reliance on herbal medicines is relatively high and the global use of herbal medicine is growing. Most pregnant women believe that these medicines are ‘natural’ and ‘safe’ com­pared to modern drugs. Besides, traditional medicine is believed to treat medical problems and improve health status during pregnancy, birth and postpartum care in many rural areas (Khadivzadeh and Ghabel, 2012).  Erhun, Agbani and Adesanya, (2004) opted that many pregnant women that are involved in such practice acquire the knowledge from relatives, neighbours, friends, traditional medicine dealers and sometimes media (Shah, 2004). The situation is predominant due to the limited antenatal health delivery centers and defective functional health institutions (Rohra, 2008); poor medical services and attitude of medical staff; lack of professional control of pharmaceutical products (Abrahams and Jewkes, 2002) as well as high illiteracy level and cost of synthetic malaria medicine over traditional orthodox  ones (Dossou-Yov, 2001). In addition, several factors such as; socioeconomic status of the women, poverty issues, cultural perception, age, sex, income level, religion and belief of certain diseases'' entity and their perceived responses to indigenous medications have been widely reported as indicators that influences their attitude (WHO, 2002); Hence, herbal traditional medication for curing malaria has become a norm and is widely practiced and patronized by pregnant women owing to general ease of access, social and cultural influences, perceived efficacy and beliefs about its safety (Langloid-Klassen, 2007). Kyomuhendo (2005) noted that pregnant women decisions regarding health and antenatal care attendance are influenced by the patriarchal system of society that gives men control over resources to the disadvantage of women. This study therefore, aims at examining the use of traditional medicine in the treatment of malaria among pregnant women in Abraka, Delta State, Nigeria.'),
       (7, 'THE ROLE OF NURSES IN MANAGEMENT OF THYPHOID IN WEST AFRICA', 'One of the principal diseases causing morbidity and mortality in the tropical regions is typhoid fever. Typhoid fever is a serious acute febrile syndrome that is very common in tropical countries. (Nguri, 2011). The mode of transmission of Typhoid fever is through food ingestion. It could also be as a result of contamination of food with infected persons feces which has the presence of Salmonella enteric serovar Typhi (Magnum & Magnum, 2014). There is the movement of the bacteria resulting from perforation into the intestinal. This results in macrophages phagocytizing it. The family of the Genus Salmonella is the Entero bacteria facultative Gram-negative bacilli. It is identified by a biochemical test and antigen structure. Patients infected with Typhoid fever demonstrate the features of high fever, myaliga, headache, stomach pain, sore throat, and diarrhoea. In some instances, the term "enteric fever" collective represent all typhoid and paratyphoid cases (Kanungu, Dutta & Sur, 2008). In most cases, when Typhoid fever is not attended to early, it may end in the death of the individual. Heyman reports as cited from the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention that, globally their e over 17 million cases of Typhoid which results in more than 600,000 deaths yearly. In the developing world, Nguri (2011) reports that, is threat affecting about 12.5 million persons annually. Notwithstanding, in most situations, the effect of the incidence and the actual health effect of Typhoid remains unexplored within the Sub 2 Saharan region. Marks et al (2010) report that key among the barriers to knowing the effect and incidence of Typhoid within the Sub-Saharan Africa is the issue of lack of diagnostic laboratories. As a result, there are wrong diagnosis as fatal Typhoid Fever is often interpreted as malaria (Evans et al, 2004; Reddy,2010).'),

In order to improve the standard of health of the patients and keep them progressively fit. The reason why such lapse are present here to be sought and the remedy met in order to achieve the set objective of the hospital. This study is based on the Attitude of nurses towards Relapse prevention among psychiatric patients in Federal neuropsychiatric hospital Barnawa Kaduna. The aim and objective of this study are all directed towards bringing out lasting solutions to curtail this menace. It also intends to actively involve the management of the hospital especially on employing new and scientific approach to holistic patient care. The instruments used for data collection were from interview and Questionnaire which were represented in tabular form, bar chart, pie chart and percentages. Nurses were used for the study .the data collected were analyzed. The result showed that many factor contribute to the effect of relapse. All these can be prevented through adequate Education, Family oriented therapies, good social support, compliance and keep the follow-up appointment'),
       (10, 'FACTORS AFFECTING EXCLUSIVE BREASTFEEDING PRACTICE AMONG NURSING MOTHERS', 'Breastfeeding is unequaled way of providing ideal food for the health, growth and development of infants and most natural way of feeding them in all traditions. It is an integral part of the reproductive process with important implications for the health of the mother. Human milk is the most appropriate of all available types of milk, that is uniquely adapted for infant nutrition as it components consistently adopt to the child’s need and environmental challenges. Breast milk contains virtually all the nutrients antibodies and anti-oxidants an infant needs to thrive for the first six months of life (Abasiattai, Umana, Nyong and Eyo, 2014). The benefits of breast feeding for mothers and infants have been widely recognized and researched studies have shown that breastfeeding is superior to infant formula feeding because of its protective properties against illness, in addition to its nutritional advantages (Sadoh, Oniyelu, 2011). Considering the extensive benefits of breastfeeding, the world Health organization and the American Dietetic Association recommended exclusive breast feeding of infants for the first six months and continued breastfeeding with complementary foods up to twelve (12) months of age (ADA Report, 2001). Despite widespread efforts to encourage breastfeeding, the rates in the United States (U.S) have remained low (Pugh, 2002).'),
       (11, 'RECREATIONAL HEALTH PRACTICES OF PREGNANT WOMEN', 'Universally, and in contemporary societies like Nigeria pregnancy being an important phase in the life of women has been found from previous studies to be a risk factor associated with decreased physical activity. Nevertheless, women also wish to be physically active during pregnancy as it is expected of every healthy pregnant women to do 30 minutes or more of light or moderate physical activities or exercise on most days of the week if it is impossible to do it in all days of the week (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), 2012). This also shows that pregnant mothers need exercises because of its importance to increased blood circulation in the body system of a pregnant mother. Physical activity and exercise are important components of a healthy lifestyle. According to the World Confederation for Physical Therapy (WCPT, 2011) exercise in pregnancy enables pregnant women to develop, maintain and restore maximum movement and functional ability throughout their pregnancy. Exercise is defined as a planned, structured, and repetitive subset of physical activity that improves or maintains physical fitness, overall health or well-being as an intended intermediate or final objective (WCPT, 2011). Exercise during pregnancy is associated with reduced back pain improved sleep and improved health perception as shown by results from few randomized controlled trials which examined the efficacy and safety of exercise during pregnancy. Historically, pregnancy was regarded as a state of confinement. More recently, however, results from researches demonstrated many potential health benefits of aerobic and strength-conditioning exercise in pregnancy and the postpartum period. It is now considered safe, and even advisable, for otherwise healthy pregnant women to initiate or continue an active lifestyle during pregnancy. Lack of exercise during pregnancy might result in loss of muscular and cardiovascular fitness, excessive maternal weight gain with a raised risk of GDM, varicose veins, dyspnea, lower-back pain and poor psychological adjustment. Previous studies have reported that exercise during the second half of pregnancy could reduce the severity of lower back pain. A study was carried out to evaluate a population of pregnant women and results suggest that the practice of water-based physical activity is beneficial to pregnant women, although it was not associated with any increase in quality of life. Although exercise programs during pregnancy after childbirth is designed to minimize impairment and helps the woman maintain or regain function while she is preparing for the arrival of the baby and then caring for the infant, it is submitted that pregnant women are not meeting the exercise recommendations of previous studies (De-Barros, Lopes, Francisco, Sapienza & Zugaib, 2010). This is linked to numerous factors such as the beliefs and attitudes of pregnant women with respect to exercise in pregnancy, level of knowledge, level of education, safety concern of the pregnant woman especially a precious pregnanacy and her physician, race/ethnicity, and previous involvement in regular exercise (Mbada, Adebayo, Adeyemi, Arije & Dada, 2014). Studies have also shown that pregnant women’s perception and attitude towards exercise in pregnancy was influenced mostly by tiredness, lack of feeling to exercise, and insufficient information on exercise. Similar findings have been reported by other authors (Cioffi, Schmied, Dahlen, Mills& Thornton, 2014). Furthermore, knowledge about benefit and contraindication to antenatal exercise significantly influences the perception and attitude of the women towards exercise in pregnancy. There is ample and consistent evidence that physical activity and exercises in women of reproductive age may be a promising approach for the prevention of excessive weight gain, gestational diabetes mellitus and subsequent complication suffered by children born from pregnancies (Ferraro, Rutherford, Keely, Dubois & Adamo, 2015). This finding of previous studies revealed that there is significant association between adequate knowledge of antenatal exercises and perceived benefits of exercise during pregnancy among women of reproductive age (Abedzadeh, Saberi & Sadat, 2015). Since pregnancy is an ideal time for behaviour modification and for adopting a healthy lifestyle because of increased motivation and frequent access to medical supervision. Patients are more likely to control weight, increase physical activity, and improve their diet physician recommends that they do so. Therefore, motivation counseling tools have been used successfully for diet and exercise counseling. Therefore, pregnancy is a good time to develop healthy lifestyle habits including regular exercise and good nutrition.'),

Special condition and great length of times were needed for these remains to undergo complex chemical changes to for oil. These are sometimes concentrated in accumulations which man can detect and exploit. Oil exploitation began more than a hundred years ago, when drilling was carried out near oil seeps which indicated that oil lay below the surface. Today, much more sophisticated techniques are employed such as seismic surveying and satellite imaging, powerful computers assist geologist in interpreting their finding. At the end of the day however, only the drill can determine whether or not oil lies blow the ground.'),

Candle is a round stick of wax with a wig through it, which is lit to give light as it burn. Oxford Advanced learner’s dictionary Fourth Edition (1989). There are many types of candles based on the production and the composition formulation from which the candle is made (or the materials you use). Candles can be manufactured in a small scale or larger scale. The small-scale process can be done either at home or laboratory, following while the large-scale process is produced in industrial and companies the scientific and technical process. The method of making a candle product can be quite interesting if done with the knowledge and adequate skills which a student in a higher institution of learning should be able to accomplish. Candles have accomplished mankind for more than 2000 years. Besides their liturgical relevance, candles were predominantly used as a source of light and in the early history of the candle are the effects to improve its quality. Beeswax candles had been developed by the Romans to such an extent that by approximately the middle of the second century A. D. they could be burnt in a closed room without soothing annoyingly or excessively beeswax candles showed significant advantages when compared to tallow candles. The latter had a rancid odour and smoked and soothed whilst burning. It was only as late as the mid nineteenth century that steering and paraffin wax offered further high quality raw materials available for the manufacture of candles alongside beeswax. During the same period decisive improvements were made to wicks, in particular the braiding techniques and chemical treatments. So further prerequisites for candles that burnt well were fulfilled and Geothe’s dream, “I know not what you could invent better than candles that burn without smoking”. The myth surrounding the candle remains even today, although numerous and various types of light are available to us since the invention of electric light and its introduction into our daily lives. Candlelight is still associated with a festival laid table, a pleasant coffee morning or idyllic romantic hours spent together. Obviously, a candle that burns well and does not soot is a must for enjoying such occasions. Soothing and dripping are the decisive quality criteria of the consumer when judging candles. Further, the environmental awareness of today the candle as a product with an open flame is naturally drawn into discussions concerning the possible negative effects on humans and nature by potentially harmful substances. Traditional craftmanship, training and the passing down of experience all go together to guarantee the production of high quality candles by specialized candle companies. The Egyptians formed candles that were made out of beeswax as early as 3000 BC. The day candle holders found in Egypt date back to 400 BC. The Chinese created candles from wahle fat during the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC). In early china and Japan, tapers were made with wax from insect and seeds, wrapped in paper the word Zhu in Chinese originally meant torch and could have the warring states period (403-221BC), some excavated Bronx wares from that era feature a picket though to hold a candle. Candles were manufacture in AD-1500 AD, here there is a fish called the evlachonor “candle fish”, a type of smelt which is found from Oregon to Alaska. During the first century AD, indigenous people from this region used oil from this fish for illumination. By the 18thcentury, the Chinese designed weights into the sides of candles, as such a candle melted, the weights fell off and made a noise as they fell into a bowl. In 1750, spermaceti, oil that comes from sperm whale, was used to provide very expensive candles. By 1800, a much cheaper attentive was discovered. Colza oil, derived from Brassica campestris, and similar oil derived from rapeseed, yielded candles that produce clear smokeless flames. The French chemist Michel Eugene Chevrev (1786-1889) and Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac (1778-1850) patented stearin, in 1811, like tallow, this was derived from animals, but had no glycerin content. The second patent ever granted by the US (United States) in 1790 for a new method of candle making was Joseph Sampson.  In 1834, Joseph Morgan began to industrialize the production of candles. He invented a machine to manufacture 1,500 per hour from a mould.  A chemist called Laurent distile paraffin from schist in 1830. another chemist, Dumes obtained paraffin from coal-tar in 1935. not until 1850 did paraffin become commercially viable when James young filed a patent to produce it from coal. Paraffin could be used to make inexpensive candles of high quality. The oldest candle manufactures still in existence are Rathbornes Candles, founded in Dulblin in 1488. Excavations at pimply, Italy, discovered several candelabra. Yak butter was used for candles in Tibet in Europe, the earliest surviving candle was discovered near Avigon infrance, from the first century AD. Tallow, fat from cows or sheep became the standard materials used in candles in Europe. Dating from about 1330, the wax chandlers company acquired its charter in 1484. by 1415, tallow candles were used in street lighting. The unpleasant smell of tallow candles is due to the glycerin they contain. For churches and royal events, candles from beeswax were used as the smell was usually less unpleasant. The smell of the manufacturing process was so unpleasant that it was banned by ordinance in several cities. In Rome, they used tallow, derived from suet, a crumbly animal fat to make the candles. Although the tallow was extremely smoky, the smoke was forgiven for light and used for prayer.  The first candle mould was believed to come from 15th century in Paris. The first American Colonist discovered that bayberries could be used to make candles, but the yield was very poor. Fiufteen pounds of wax. A simple, candle could be made by putting the dried fish on a forked stick and then lighting it. Candles were made for timekeeping. Anglo-saxon king Alfred the Great (C. 849-899) used a candle clock which burned for 4 hours. There were lines around the side to show the passing of each hour. Later, 24hours candles were invented based on the same concept. The sung dynasty in china (960-1279) also used candle-clocks. A form of candle-clock was used in coal mining until the twentieth century. Despite advances in candle making, the candle industry was devastated soon after by the distillation of kerosene (an excellent fuel for amps). In Britain, kerosene is known as paraffin oil or paraffin despite having little to do with paraffin wax. In 1829, William Wilson of prices candles invested in 1000 ores (4km2) of coconut plantation in srilanka. His aim was to make candles from coconut oil. Later he tried palm oil from palm trees. An accidental discovery swept all his ambitions aside when his brother George Wilson distilled the first petroleum oil in 1854. In 1919, Lever Brothers purchased prices candles and in 1922, a joint owned company called “candle Ltd” was created. By 1991, the last remaining owner of “candle Ltd” was shell oil company, who sold off the candle making part of business from this point, candles became more of a decorative item.'),

However, overproduction of these free radical may lead to damage to valuable biomolecules such as DNA, lipids and proteins. These free radicals are often associated with the oxidation in food and biological systems which will cause oxidative rancidity in foods and the development of several human diseases such as neurological degeneration, diabetes and certain types of cancer (Magalhaes, 2006). An antioxidant is any substance which is capable of delaying, preventing the oxidative damage of lipids, protein and nucleic acids by reactive oxygen species, which include reactive free radicals such as superoxide, hydroxyl, peroxyl, alkoxyl and non-radicals such as hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous (Lim et al., 2007). Thus, antioxidants have gained numerous attention in the past few years, especially within the food, biological and agrochemical fields. There is increasing evidence that the consumptionof vegetables and fruits is associated with a reduced risk of degenerative disease such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and cataracts (Chinnici et al., 2004). This association is often attributed to the natural antioxidant present in fruits and vegetables, such as vitamin C and E, carotenoids, phenolic acids and flavonoids, which prevent free radical damage (Silva et al., 2004). Epidemiological studies have established a positive correlation between the intake of fruits and vegetables and prevention of diseases like atherosclerosis, cancer, diabetes, arthritis and also ageing (Kaur and Kapoor, 2001). Annonamuricata L. (A. muricata) is one of the tropical fruits that demonstrate antioxidant properties. This plant contains annonaceousacetogenins in the twigs, unripe fruit, seeds, roots, and bark tissues, which display antitumor, pesticidal, antimalarial, anthelmintic, piscicidal, antiviral, and antimicrobial effects, thus suggesting many potentially useful applications. Ripe A. muricata pulp extract contains three prominent acetogenins: asimici, bullatacin, and bullatalicin. Previous research on A. muricata was focused on the leaves, seeds and roots for pharmaceutical purposes (Gleeve et al., 1997; Jaramillo et al., 2000; Onimawo, 2002). Little attention has been paid to the study of thepulp and peel of A. muricata fruit. This study was therefore conducted to compare the antioxidant properties, phyto-constituents, proximate and mineral compositions of the peel and pulp of A. muricata. Perseaamericana Mill (Luraceae) is one of the 150 varieties of avocado pear. The tree is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical areas (Lu et al., 2005). The seed of P. americana (avocado seed) has diverse application in ethno–medicine, ranging from treatment for diarrhea, dysentery, toothache, intestinal parasites, skin treatment and beautification. The avocado seed oil has several health benefits e.g. for controlling human weight (especially used for obese for weight loss) (Lopez et al., 1996; Roger, 1999). P. americana leaves have been reported to have or possess anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities (Adeyemi et al., 2002). The edible part (fruit) is very popular in vegetarian cuisine, making a substitute for meat in sandwiches and salads, because of its high fat content and high in valuable, health-promoting fats (Lu et al., 2005). The fruit is not sweet but fatty, almost distinctly, yet subtly flavoured, and of smooth, almost creamy texture. Avocado fruits in many countries such as Mexico, Brazil, South Africa and India are frequently used for milkshakes and occasionally added to ice-cream (Zeldes, 2010). While several works had been reported on the chemical characterization of phyto-constituents of P. americana fruit, there is still limited information on its potential use in the management/prevention of degenerative diseases associated with oxidative stress. Hence, the objective of this study is to investigate the anti-oxidative properties and inhibitory effect of phenolic extracts of the leaves and fruit parts of P. americana on Fe2+ induced lipid oxidation. The plant Cola lepidota, also known as monkey cola in West Cameroons, Duala, mbwid; ojiochicha (cockroach cola) or achicha (Iwu, 1993) amongst the Ibo speaking people of Nigeria, belongs to the sterculiaceae family. It grows wild and sometimes cultivated in the tropics especially distributed in lower Guinea, Gabon, Western Cameroon and Eastern Nigeria. The phyto-constituents found in the seed of Cola lepidota include falvones; glycosides, saponins, steroids (Burkill, 1985). The seed has been used as febrifuges, for pulmonary disorders, and as an anticancer (Engel et al., 2011). Until now, there has not been a report on the antioxidant activity of any part of Cola lepidota. As part of an ongoing biological evaluation of medicinal plants for their therapeutic uses, the current study was carried out to determine the free radical scavenging activity vizavis the antioxidant activity. Oxidation of biological molecules has been postulated to induce a variety of pathological events such as diabetes, pancreatitis and ageing (Finkel and Holbrook, 2000). Evidence has shown that these damaging events are caused by free radicals (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1993). Free radicals are unstable species because they have unpaired electron pairing with biological macromolecules. It is well established that free radicals are associated with process that leads to cell degeneration, especially in organs such as brain and pancreas (Shulman et al., 2004). Unchecked activities ofROS had been linked to health disorders such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, gastric ulcers, reperfusion, arthritis and inflammatory diseases (Halliwell, 1989; Vajragupta et al., 2000). In the pancreas, Fe accumulates in acinar cells and in the islets of Langerhans, thereby resulting in the destruction of β-cells associated with diabetes mellitus (Shah and Fonseca, 2011). High levels of both Cu and Fe, with low levels of Zn and Mn play a crucial role in the progression of several degenerative diseases (Johnson, 2001). Although Fe is necessary physiologically as components ofmany enzymes and proteins, free Fe in the cytosol and mitochondria could cause considerable oxidative damage by acting catalytically in the production of ROS which have the potential to damage cellular lipids, nucleic acids, proteins and carbohydrate resulting in wide-ranging impairment in cellular function and integrity (Britton et al., 2002). ROS can directly attack the polyunsaturated fatty acids of the cell membranes and induce lipid peroxidation. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is the endproduct of lipid peroxidation, which is a process where reactive oxygen species (ROS) degrade polyunsaturated fatty acids. This compound is a reactive aldehyde and is one of the many reactive electrophile species that cause toxic stress in cells and form advanced glycation end-products. The production of this aldehyde is used as a biomarker to measure the level of oxidative stress in an organism (Murray et al., 2000). However, the most likely and practical way to fight degenerative diseases is to improve body antioxidant status, which could be achieved by higher consumption of fruits and vegetables. Foods of plant origin usually contain natural antioxidants such as phenolic compounds that can scavenge free radicals (Sun et al., 2002; Alia et al., 2003; Oboh and Akindahunsi, 2004; Oboh, 2005). Medicinal plant have continued to attract attention in the global search for effective methods of using plants’ parts (e.g. seeds, stems, leaves, roots and bark etc) for the treatment of many diseases affecting humans (Sofowora, 1993). Many important drugs used in medicine today are directly or indirectly derived from plants due to its bioactive constituents such as; alkaloids, steroids, tannins e.t.c (Cordeiro and Oniyangi, 1998). In recent years, secondary plant metabolites previously with unknown pharmacological activities have been extensively investigated as sources of medicinal agents (Krishnaraju et al., 2005). Phenolic compounds are an important group of secondary metabolites, which are synthesized by plants because of plant adaptation to biotic and a biotic stress condition such as infection, water stress, and cold stress (Oboh and Rocha 2007). In recent years, phenolic compounds have attracted the interest of researchers because of their antioxidants capacity; they can protect the human body from free radicals, whose formation is associated with the normal natural metabolism of aerobic cells. The antiradical activity of flavonoidsand phenols is principally based on the structural relationship between different parts of their chemical structure (Rice-Evans et al., 1996).'),
       (15, 'NUTRITIONAL PHYTOCHEMICAL AND MICROBIAL CONTENT OF BOMBAX COSTATUM LEAVE', 'Plants have been an important source of medicine for thousands of years. Even today, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that up to 80% of people still rely primarily on traditional remedies such as herbs for their medicines. The medicinal value of these plants is due to the presence of a variety of phytochemicals and their elemental composition. The role of medicinal plants in disease prevention or control has been attributed to the antioxidant properties of their constituents, usually associated with a wide range of amphipathic molecules that are broadly referred to as polyphenolic compounds. There is a growing interest in the development and evaluation of natural antioxidants from medicinal plant materials in the food industry and the field of preventive health care. Among those herbs, one promising species is Bombax costatum leaves, which is native to the sub-Himalayan regions of Northwest India. It is widely distributed throughout Africa, Saudi Arabia, Southeast Asia, the Caribbean Islands, and South America. Every part of Bombax costatum leaves has medicinal properties and is commercially exploitable for the development of medicinal and industrial by-products. Traditionally, the leaves, fruits, flowers, and immature pods of this tree are edible; they are used as a highly nutritive vegetable in many countries, particularly in India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Hawaii, and some African nations. In developing nations, Bombax costatum leaves is used as an alternative to imported food supplements to treat and combat malnutrition, especially among infants and nursing mothers, by virtue of its chemical constituents. Several valuable reviews of the ethno botanical uses of Bombax costatum leaves are available. It has been found to be a good source of polyphenols and antioxidants. Phytochemicals such as vanillin, omega fatty acids, carotenoids, ascorbates, tocopherols, beta-sitosterol, moringine, kaempferol, and quercetin have been reported in its flowers, roots, fruits, and seeds. The leaves, in particular, have been found to contain phenolics and flavonoids; these compounds have various biological activities, including antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, immunomodulatory, antidiabetic, antiatherogenic, and hepatoprotective functions and the regulation of thyroid status. Moreover, leaves contain trace elements that are essential to human health. For instance, magnesium, iron, selenium, and zinc play an important role in metabolism, and interest in these elements is increasing together with reports relating trace element status and oxidative diseases. However, a recent study has shown that dried Bombax costatum leaves contain lead at very high values of 352.0 mg/L. Therefore, it is very important to identify the mineral composition of Bombax costatum leaves that are widely consumed by humans and animals. In Mexico, Bombax costatum leaves are widely cultivated in different zones of the country and are found in more than ten states from Sonora to Oaxaca on the Pacific side. Few studies have been conducted on nutritional and phytochemical composition; however, to date, a detailed composition of the leaves of Bombax costatum leaves that is native to Mexico has not been reported yet. In addition, it is important to bear in mind that the mineral and phenolic contents present in leaves depend on several factors such as geographical area where the plant is cultivated, type of soil, water and fertilizers, industrialization process, and storage conditions.');
